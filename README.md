# Unofficial Ghidra Debian Package

This repository provides an **unofficial `.deb` package** for installing [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra), the open-source reverse engineering framework developed by the National Security Agency (NSA).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to simplify the installation of Ghidra on Debian-based Linux distributions by offering a pre-built `.deb` package.  
This initiative is intended as a community contribution and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the NSA or the official Ghidra development team**.
